## 1.0 Tweet Scraper
Two methods are used to scrape and dump Tweets using [Twitter API for Academic research](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research), they could produce exactly the same results. Method 1 was written by me, while Method 2 calls the [twarc package](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc). Method 2 is recommended because it's more convenient and understandable: all the raw codes are encapsulated, and it's possible to finish all the work with only one line. 
### 1.1 Method 1
The tweetScraper.ipynb is the main program, all the other py files are functions used in the tweetScraper program.
  
### 1.2 Method 2
The [twarc package](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc)
